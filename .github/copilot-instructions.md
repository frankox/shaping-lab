# Project Context
This is an interactive web application built with TypeScript and p5.js that simulates a 2D environment with:
- An Agent that moves randomly within a canvas
- Static objects (circle, square, diamond) 
- A reward system for reinforcement learning, to simulate a shaping session
- Pretraining logic for the agent (if applicable)

## Code Standards
- Use TypeScript with strict type checking
- Follow object-oriented programming principles
- Use ES6+ features and modern JavaScript patterns
- Maintain clean separation between classes and responsibilities
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Do not write unnecessary comments; code should be self-explanatory
- Maintain the copilot-instructions file up-to-date with any changes in architecture or 
- Use self closing tags for HTML elements in TypeScript files

## Agent Workflow Optimization
- Always prefer direct actions over questions when requirements are clear or can be inferred from context.
- Gather all necessary context before making changes; use workspace structure and file naming conventions to locate relevant code.
- When editing, use concise, minimal diffs and avoid unnecessary repetition.
- Use the latest TypeScript and ES features for performance and maintainability.
- Prioritize atomic, self-contained changes to minimize errors and maximize reliability.
- Validate changes by checking for errors after each edit, and resolve them if possible before proceeding.
- Keep this file updated with any new workflow, architecture, or process changes that impact agent efficiency.

## Copilot Chat Instructions
- When describing changes, be minimal and precise.
- When writing in chat, keep explanations concise and focused, be minimal and avoid repetition.
- Avoid asking for confirmation on every execution, assume the agent understands the context and can make informed decisions.
- Avoid unnecessary prompts; if clarification is needed, ask specific questions.
- Avoid emotional language or expressions.

## Architecture & File Structure

### Root Directory
- `package.json`: Project dependencies and scripts
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration

### src/
- `Agent.ts`: Agent class with movement, rendering, and reward logic
- `StaticObjects.ts`: Static object classes (Circle, Square, Diamond)
- `main.ts`: Main environment controller and p5.js integration
- `NeuralNetwork.ts`: Neural network logic (if used)
- `pretrain.ts`: Pretraining logic (if used)
- `types.ts`: Shared TypeScript interfaces and types
- `p5-globals.d.ts`: Type definitions for p5.js

### dist/
- Compiled JavaScript output from TypeScript build (not committed, generated by build process)

### public/
- `index.html`: Main HTML file for the app
- `pretrain.html`: HTML for pretraining interface (if used)
- `styles.css`: Application styles
- `Agent.js`, `main.js`, `NeuralNetwork.js`, `pretrain.js`, `StaticObjects.js`, `types.js`: Compiled JavaScript files for each TypeScript source

### .github/
- `copilot-instructions.md`: Workspace-specific Copilot instructions

This structure ensures a clear separation between source code, build output, and public assets. All TypeScript source files are in `src/`, compiled JavaScript is output to `dist/`, and files served to the browser are in `public/`.

## Development Workflow
- TypeScript files are in `src/` directory
- Compiled JavaScript goes to `dist/` directory  
- Public files are served from `public/` directory
- Use `npm run build` to compile TypeScript
- Use `npm run dev` to build and start development server

## Agent Best Practices
- Use file and directory structure to infer intent and relationships between components.
- When in doubt, prefer convention over configuration.
- Avoid unnecessary prompts; act unless user clarification is essential.
- Ensure all code changes are consistent with project standards and structure.
- Document any significant architectural or workflow changes in this file for future agent reference.
