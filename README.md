# Shaping Lab - Neural Network Training Simulator

A web-based interactive simulator for training neural network agents through shaping techniques. The agent learns to navigate a 2D environment using manual rewards/punishments and intrinsic feedback mechanisms.

## What is Shaping Lab?

Shaping Lab is an educational and experimental tool that demonstrates **behavioral shaping** - a machine learning technique inspired by psychology. You control a virtual environment where an AI agent (represented by a small circle) learns to behave through positive and negative feedback, just like training a pet or teaching a child.

### How it Works

The AI agent starts with a basic neural network "brain" that doesn't know how to behave. It moves around randomly at first. As you watch its behavior and give it rewards (when it does something good) or punishments (when it does something bad), the neural network learns and adapts its behavior over time.

### Quick Start Guide

**üéØ Goal: Train your agent to stay inside the circle**

1. **Start the app** - You'll see a canvas with:
   - A **red dot** (your AI agent) moving randomly
   - A **green circle** (target area)
   - A **blue square** and **orange triangle** (other shapes)
   - **Control buttons** at the bottom

2. **Manual Training** (hands-on experience):
   - Click the ‚öôÔ∏è settings button
   - Enable **"Intrinsic Punishment"** (helps discourage inactivity)
   - Enable **"Gradient Rewards"** (makes learning more effective)
   - Close settings and watch the agent move
   - Click **"Reward"** when the agent enters the green circle

3. **Experiment with Networks**:
   - Try different neural network architectures (Simple MLP, Residual MLP, Recurrent LSTM)
   - Each has different learning characteristics and capabilities

4. **Advanced Features**:
   - Adjust reward and punishment settings for different learning behaviors
   - Try different timeframes for intrinsic punishment
   - Experiment with gradient reward ranges

### What Makes This Special?

- **Real-time Learning**: Watch the AI change its behavior as you train it
- **Visual Feedback**: See exactly what the agent is "thinking" and how it responds
- **Hands-on ML Education**: Experience machine learning concepts interactively
- **Behavioral Psychology**: Understand how shaping works in both AI and animal training

## Architecture

### Component Structure

- **App.tsx**: Main application component managing state and coordination
- **Agent.ts**: Agent logic with position, movement, and neural network integration
- **CanvasManager.ts**: Rendering engine for 2D canvas visualization
- **NeuralNetworkWrapper.ts**: TensorFlow.js integration with multiple architectures
- **RewardManager.ts**: Handles reward distribution, gradient calculation, and state buffering
- **Settings.tsx**: Configuration UI with network selection and parameter tuning

### Agent System
- **Position & Movement**: 2D position with heading and velocity
- **Neural Network Interface**: 7-input network (position, distances to shapes, heading, velocity)
- **Action Space**: Rotation direction/speed and forward movement speed
- **Constraint System**: Keeps agent within canvas boundaries

### Learning Pipeline
1. Agent perceives environment state (position, distances to shapes)
2. Neural network predicts movement actions based on current architecture
3. Agent applies actions and moves in the environment
4. States are buffered for batch learning
5. Manual rewards/punishments trigger training
6. Network weights are updated using gradient-based learning
7. Experience replay improves learning stability

## Usage

### Manual Training Session

For hands-on experience with reinforcement learning:

1. **Start**: Agent begins moving randomly
2. **Observe**: Watch agent behavior and movement patterns
3. **Reward**: Click "Reward" when agent performs desired actions (e.g., entering the circle)
4. **Configure**: Use settings to enable gradient rewards and intrinsic punishment
5. **Iterate**: Continue rewarding good behavior until patterns emerge

### Network Architecture Comparison

- **Simple MLP**: Fast training, good for basic behaviors (32‚Üí16‚Üí8 neurons)
- **Residual MLP**: Better for complex behaviors, uses skip connections (64‚Üí64‚Üí32 neurons)
- **Recurrent LSTM**: Memory-based, excellent for temporal patterns and sequences

### Recommended Training Scenario

**Goal**: Teach agent to stay inside the circle

**Manual Training Method**:
1. Enable intrinsic punishment (3-10 second timeframe)
2. Enable gradient rewards (min=0, max=1)
3. Reward agent every time it enters or stays in the circle
4. After 10-15 reward events, agent should prefer the circle area
5. Reduce manual rewards to test learned behavior
